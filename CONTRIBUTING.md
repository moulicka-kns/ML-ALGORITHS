# Contribution Guidelines

If you think an algorithm is missing or placed in the wrong category and want to contribute (please do), open a pull request with the modified changes and I'll be happy to merge. You can make one of the following types of changes in each pull request:

### 1. Adding an algorithm to README:
- Please make an individual commit for each algorithm for easier maintenance.
- Keep in mind that when you are adding to the list, the link to the article should be simple enough to understand the theoretical concepts.
- Make sure a duplicate algorithm doesn't already exist under another category.
- The title of the pull request should be of the format: `Added <new-algorithm-name> to README`.


### 2. Adding your own script to `scripts` folder:
- If you have made any python program on these algorithms and want to help, please add it to the scripts folder with the file name like `<algorithm-name>.py`
- If another script for an algorithm exists, please don't add your own. Instead, see if anything would make the existing script better.
- The title of the pull request should be of the format: `Added <new-algorithm-name>.py to scripts`.
